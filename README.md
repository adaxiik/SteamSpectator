# SteamSpectator

You can simply find out how many hours you (or your friends) have played since you last turned on the program<br>
**Your Steam Profile must be Public**<br>

# How it works ?
It use [SteamID.xyz](https://steamid.xyz/) to convert Custom Steam URL to ID64 and then get games from 
 *"https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/{STEAM64ID}/games/?tab=all&xml=1"* and compare with playtimes from the last time <br>

# Usage
Install requirements.txt<br>
Delete .gitkeep from **/Profiles** and start **SteamSpectator.py**<br>
