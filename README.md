# SteamSpectator

You can simpy find out how many hours you (or your friends) have played since you last turned on the program<br><br>
**Your Steam Profile must be Public**

## How it works ?
It use [SteamID.xyz](https://steamid.xyz/) to convert Custom Steam URL to ID64 and then get games from 
 *"https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/{STEAM64ID}/games/?tab=all&xml=1"* and compare with playtimes from the last time
